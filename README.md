projects
========

This repository is used to provide skeletal outlines for any of my future projects

It is based on ideas from 

 1. [Zed. A. Shaw][hard]
 2. [Kenneth Reitz][blog]
 3. [Kiran Gangadharan][boot]
 4. [Audrey Roy][cookie]
 5. [Zulco][picnic]
 
I have adapted their ideas to my own style, because I have some python, some bash projects; prefer doctests to unittests, und so weiter.
